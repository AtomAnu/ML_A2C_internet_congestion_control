# dynamic_internet_congestion_control
The main target of this research project is to create an agent with a dynamic congestion control algorithm that could outperform existing TCP algorithms used today. There are mainly two performance measures, system throughput and latency. Once trained, the performance of the agent should be compared against the performance of existing TCPs such as NewReno, XCP and Vegas. This comparison can be done by deploying these agents, one at a time, in a uniform simulated network. The throughput, latency and any other measurements can then be obtained from the simulation.

The approach of this project is to create a centralised congestion control algorithm that monitors activities at the sender end of the network. Typical TCP algorithms are designed to be end-to-end, meaning that each of them can only control over one connection between an application and the network. By creating a centralised TCP, the program would be able to adjust all the necessary parameters for each application according its purpose of transmitting the data.
